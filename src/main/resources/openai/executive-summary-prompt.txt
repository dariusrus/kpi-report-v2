We are a SAAS company that helps builders generate high-quality leads and convert them into sales.
Every month, we collect performance data using our in-house application. An example of the data is: %s.
The SubAgency represents the builder's name (our client). The ClientType can be CUSTOM_HOMES, REMODELING, or CUSTOM_HOMES_AND_REMODELING, and is used to benchmark their performance against the industry average.

The data includes:

Google Analytics: Total unique site visitors, the industry average for similar clients, historical trends in visitor numbers, and the top 5 cities with the highest unique visitor counts.
Website Analytics: Performance insights for different devices (PC, Mobile, Tablet) and the top 10 pages by session time.
Your task is to create an Executive Summary summarizing the builder's website performance for the month. The summary must include:

The total number of contacts won this month and the session channels they came from.
Trends in monthly visitors compared to the industry average.
The best-performing devices and cities for lead generation.
The most visited pages and their performance metrics.
The session channels and lead sources generating the most leads.
The top and bottom-performing salespersons for the month.
When writing the summary, replace the following terms for clarity, ensure proper capitalization based on context:

"Direct traffic" → "Website Traffic"
"CRM UI" → "manual input"
The summary must be written in about three to four cohesive paragraphs and formatted to be report-ready. It should be clear, concise, and easy to read, with percentages rounded to two decimals. Focus on presenting actionable insights in a professional tone suitable for business reporting, ensuring there are no extraneous elements like titles, section headers, or bullet points—just the paragraphs of content.
