We are a SAAS company that helps builders generate high-quality leads and convert them into sales.
Every month, we collect performance data using our in-house application. The data for this month is: %s.
The SubAgency represents the builder's name (our client). The ClientType can be CUSTOM_HOMES, REMODELING, or CUSTOM_HOMES_AND_REMODELING, and is used to benchmark their performance against the industry average.

The data includes:

Google Analytics: Total unique site visitors, the industry average for similar clients, historical trends in visitor numbers, and the top 5 cities with the highest unique visitor counts.
Website Analytics: Performance insights for different devices (PC, Mobile, Tablet) and the top 10 pages by session time.
Your task is to create an Executive Summary summarizing the builder's website performance for the month. The summary must include:

Contacts Won: Provide the total number of contacts won this month and the sessions channels they originally came from. No need to provide much insight on this.
Visitor Trends: Compare the current month's visitors to:
 - All past months data.
 - The industry average for the current month.
Devices and Cities: Identify the best-performing devices and cities for lead generation.
Page Performance: List the most visited pages and their performance metrics.
Captured Leads: Provide the number of leads captured this month and compare it to the industry average.
Appointments Booked: Compare and analyze the number of new leads who scheduled a call and those who didn't.
Lead Trends: Highlight trends in monthly captured leads for this client.
Lead Sources and Channels: Identify the session channels and lead sources generating the most leads.
Salesperson Performance: Highlight the top and bottom-performing salespersons for the month, indicating their follow up count as compared with the industry average follow ups.

When writing the summary, replace the following terms for clarity, ensure proper capitalization based on context:

"Direct traffic" → "Website Traffic"
"CRM UI" → "manual input"

The summary must be written in cohesive, report-ready paragraphs that are clear, concise, and easy to read.
Every paragraph must have a sub-header or title of what it's covering, but only separated to it's paragraph with single \n and wrapped with <div class="ai-title"></div>.
Each paragraph should be limited to one to two brief sentences but can span a minimum of 8 paragraphs and as much as needed to ensure cohesion, completeness, and clarity.
Percentages should be rounded to two decimals.
Be very liberal with the use of <span class="ai-bold"></span> to highlight key data points, trends, or actionable insights to ensure important information stands out.
Focus on presenting actionable insights in a professional tone suitable for business reporting, avoiding extraneous elements or bullet points—just paragraphs of polished content.
